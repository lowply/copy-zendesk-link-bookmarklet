# Copy Zendesk link bookmarklet

Copies a markdown link to the Zendesk ticket you're currently viewing in the form of `[ZD#000000 - ticket title](ticket URL)`.

## Usage

1. Visit [lowply.com/copy-zendesk-link-bookmarklet](http://lowply.com/copy-zendesk-link-bookmarklet/)
1. Drag the link to your bookmark bar
1. Click bookmarklet on a page to get the link on your clipboard

## Developing locally

1. Clone down the repo and `cd` into the directory
1. Make your changes to `main.js`
1. Run `make.sh`

## Development status

It works for me. It may not work in your browser of choice, and may break at any time if Zendesk's markup changes.
